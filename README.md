### Hi there 👋 My name is Askhat, I'm 17yo and I want to become a cool programmer! :fire: 😎:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [FNAP](https://github.com/CondInPunz/FNAP) - my own FNAF parody game.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning C, C#, C++, Kotlin, and Java. 
- 🔨 I've previously had an experience of building desktop apps with Python and Qt Framework, Pygame and creating servers with flask framework.
- 🏆 Future goals: Learn C, C#, C++, Kotlin, and Java. Also it would be awesome for me to upgrade my knowledge of English (to C1 lvl). 
- 📫 How to reach me: @justcipunz (any social media).
